# Codecademy Programming with Python Immersive: final project

This is an app I wrote for my codecademy capstone a few years ago. It provides a framework for a service that allows users to rate books.

It has quite a bit of basic functionality built in, including:
- adding, removing and modifying users and their info (books read, average rating)
- adding, removing and modifying books and their info (fiction and non-fiction, difficulty, authors, ISBN, ...)
- allowing a given user to add books and rate them
- getting most-read book, highest rated book, etc.

I've left it as it was when I submitted, so it's a bit messy and needs some work but was a great introduction to the fundamentals of python and OOP.
